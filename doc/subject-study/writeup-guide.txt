STUDY
New Recipe Cooking Observation

DESCRIPTION
Observe subject cooking a new recipe. 

GOAL
To demonstrate that learning a new recipe is a process that requires significant cognitive effort. This is measured by

METRICS
- Number of times subject checks recipe (not necessarily a measure that I expect to be to our advantage, but we should still include it.)
- Duration spent looking at recipe per check.
- Total duration spent reading recipe (sum of all recipe check durations).
- Number of additional steps carried out by subject which exceed the number of steps originally given by recipe.
