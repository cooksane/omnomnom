\section{Introduction}
Cooking can be a source of enjoyment and pride and a forum for creative experimentation. Compared to prepackaged and most restaurant meals, homemade meals can be healthier and cheaper. However, developing the proper skills to cook with confidence takes time and patience. The tools, ingredients, motor skills, effective use of heating/cooling appliances, pressures of precise timing, importance of precise timing, as well as several other factors may seem overwhelming to novices. In a world where people are on the run, prepackaged meals, restaurants, and near-instant food delivery are appealing alternatives to cooking.

Many people perceive cooking as stressful and time-consuming or simply not worth learning. We believe the difficulties involved in cooking are primarily due to cognitive overload. Getting your first meal right is almost impossible without help, and failure may discourage people from trying again. There are few resources that currently exist which help mitigate the cognitive load experienced by first-time cooks. For instance, printed cookbooks increase cognitive load, because ingredients and instructions must be memorized in order to cook without interruption. Cooking blogs (e.g., \cite{cooking_classy, allrecipes}) provide plenty of recipes and guides, but these sources are merely digital versions of printed cookbooks. Cook Assistant Lite is one cellphone application that has made cooking interactive \cite{cook_lite}, but the application requires the user to continually interact with the application, which leads to even more interruptions while cooking.

In this paper, we propose a digital cooking assistant design for novice cooks. Our design focuses on the following points:
\begin{itemize}
\item	Mitigate interruptions that are due to overutilization of visual input (necessary visual observations while cooking and having to continually read something to determine what to do next) and motor functions (hands are used for cooking and clicking through applications or scrolling on a blog).
\item Mitigate cognitive overload that is due to the physical and temporal demands of cooking, which are exacerbated by the memorization of ingredients and instructions.
\item Make instructions in recipes more accessible, teach users new cooking techniques, and help users decide what to make with the ingredients they already have at home.
\end{itemize}

Features of our design include text-to-speech instruction; timers for managing multiple simultaneous tasks; reminders to check oven and stove temperatures; easy-to-read interfaces that display one step at a time with large pictorial, audio, and/or video aids, somewhat reminiscent of turn-by-turn navigation of a GPS; and lifelines to contact other users who have previously tried the recipe.

Our approach is user-centered. We survey both novice and expert cooks in order to identify key differences between skill levels. For instance: What do novice cooks find most difficult about cooking? What prevents them from cooking more often? What motivates experts to cook? Survey results inform our design of several paper-based interfaces. We then conduct a round of in-person questionnaires to obtain feedback on multiple paper-based designs, which help to identify prominent features and issues with each design. We show multiple designs in parallel to each participant. After incorporating feedback on paper prototypes, we implement the digital design leveraging the recipe API BigOven \cite{api_oven}. To assess the quality of our digital prototype(s), we conduct a within-subject experiment, comparing user performance on cooking recipes with and without our prototype(s). During the performance phase, we collect qualitative data by observation. After each cooking session, we ask the user to assess their cooking experience based on the following factors (NASA Task Load Index): mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance, effort, and frustration. Finally, through further user testing and design/development iteration, our final product embodies the features that help first-time and novice cooks succeed in their cooking adventures.

\section{Related Work}

\section{Field Visit \#1: Blah}

On each page your material (not including the page number) should fit
within a rectangle of 18 x 23.5 cm (7 x 9.25 in.), centered on a US
letter page, beginning 1.9 cm (.75 in.) from the top of the page, with
a .85 cm (.33 in.) space between two 8.4 cm (3.3 in.) columns.  Right
margins should be justified, not ragged. Beware, especially when using
this template on a Macintosh, Word can change these dimensions in
unexpected ways. Please be sure that your PDF is US letter and not
A4. If your PDF or paper are formatted for A4, the submission will be
returned to you to fix.

\section{Field Visit \#2: Blah}

Prepare your submissions on a word processor or typesetter.  Please
note that page layout may change slightly depending upon the printer
you have specified.  \LaTeX\ sometimes will create overfull lines
that extend into columns.  To attempt to combat this, the .cls
file has a command, {\textbackslash}sloppy, that essentially asks
\LaTeX\ to prefer underfull lines with extra whitespace.  For more
details on this, and info on how to control it more finely, check out
{\url{http://www.economics.utoronto.ca/osborne/latex/PMAKEUP.HTM}}.

\subsection{Prototype Evaluation}

\section{Field Visit \#3: Blah}

Your paper's title, authors and affiliations should run across the
full width of the page in a single column 17.8 cm (7 in.) wide.  The
title should be in Helvetica 18-point bold; use Arial if Helvetica is
not available.  Authors' names should be in Times Roman 12-point bold,
and affiliations in Times Roman 12-point.  For more than three authors,
you may have to place some address information in a footnote, or in a named
section at the end of your paper. Please use full international addresses and
telephone dialing prefixes.  Leave one 10-pt line of white space below the last
line of affiliations.

\subsection{Design Observations}

\section{Related Work}

Every submission should begin with an abstract of about 150 words,
followed by a set of keywords. The abstract and keywords should be
placed in the left column of the first page under the left half of the
title. The abstract should be a concise statement of the problem,
approach and conclusions of the work described.  It should clearly
state the paper's contribution to the field of HCI.

The first set of keywords will be used to index the paper in the
proceedings. The second set are used to catalogue the paper in the ACM
Digital Library. The latter are entries from the ACM Classification
System~\cite{acm_categories}.  In general, it should only be necessary
to pick one or more of the H5 subcategories, see
\url{http://www.acm.org/class/1998/ccs98.html}

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

Please use a 10-point Times Roman font or, if this is unavailable,
another proportional font with serifs, as close as possible in
appearance to Times Roman 10-point. The Press 10-point font available
to users of Script is a good substitute for Times Roman. If Times
Roman is not available, try the font named Computer Modern Roman. On a
Macintosh, use the font named Times and not Times New Roman. Please
use sans-serif or non-proportional fonts only for special purposes,
such as headings or source code text.

\subsection{References and Citations}

Use a numbered list of references at the end of the article, ordered
alphabetically by first author, and referenced by numbers in brackets
\cite{ethics,
  Klemmer:2002:WSC:503376.503378,
  Mather:2000:MUT,
  Zellweger:2001:FAO:504216.504224}. For
papers from conference proceedings, include the title of the paper and
an abbreviated name of the conference (e.g., for Interact 2003
proceedings, use \textit{Proc. Interact 2003}). Do not include the
location of the conference or the exact date; do include the page
numbers if available. See the examples of citations at the end of this
document. Within this template file, use the \texttt{References} style
for the text of your citation.

Your references should be published materials accessible to the

easily accessible (i.e., you provide the address for obtaining the
report within your citation) and may be obtained by any reader for a
nominal fee.  Proprietary information may not be cited. Private
communications should be acknowledged in the main text, not referenced
(e.g., ``[Robertson, personal communication]'').
