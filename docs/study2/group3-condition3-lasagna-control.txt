- Subject complains "ughh it's not highlighted!" -- confused about lasagna instructions. Subject extremely confused by instructions; spending quite a long time reading the instructions. Confused about materials "I'm going to assume it means pan."
  - Very poorly written recipe instruction.

- "I am now simultaneously doing steps 1, 2, and 3, but I can't start step 3 until I have the pan from step 1, so now I am also starting step 4."
  - This is a recipe with many steps that can be executed in parallel.

- "It didn't say to chop up the garlic; or to take it out of the milk. I guess I'll just keep it in there."
  - More poor instruction.

- "I am now doing step 3 and 4 simultaneously; at least the beginning of step 4."

- Subject is expressing extreme frustration: "The recipe should say: empty all your cupboards of all your materials, you will need all of it."

- "I don't know if you guys were trying to pick recipes of equal difficultly, but you did not."
  - Recipes are definitely not of equal difficulty. Oh well.

- "There should be a step at the end that says 'Schedule your open heart surgery;' cause you're gonna need it."
  - There's alot of butter in this recipe.

- "Turned out too salty..."
  - Not specifying pan size resulted in too small a pan, and higher concentration of salt than recipe intended.
