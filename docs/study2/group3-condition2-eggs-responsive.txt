Study 2: Group 3: Eggs, Responsive

- Started step 1, while wilting spinach: "I don't have a big enough skillet, have to do it in smaller batches."
  - Material related issue.

- While drying, "I've never done this before; wilting/drying squeezes so much of the nutrition out of the spinach."
  - Largely irrelevant comment.

- Refering to the mushrooms in step 2, subject says "I don't have a scale so I can't weigh out exactly one pound."
  - Material related issue.

- "Says that cooking mushrooms should have removed all liquid after 5 minutes, but they are still releasing liquid (after 5 minutes)" - "I feel like maybe I should have chopped the mushrooms. Maybe a mistake in the recipe?"
  - Possible recipe mistake.

- "I guess I'm baking." Q: "Were you able to determine whether you'd need to bake before getting to that step?" A: "Yea, from step summary, but it also just says it in the recipe title." Q: "Could you have parallelized that task if the summary contained more information about what to set the oven temperature to?" A: "I don't know, maybe. I just figured, given where I was in the process that I was getting close to baking time, so I moved onto that step."
  - Seems summary was helpful in aiding subject in determining imporant future tasks that could be parallelized, but subject had enough experience with cooking to know intuitively when to start baking.

- "This liquid is not cooking off; and these mushrooms are turning into mush..." -- "It's alright, moving on."

- "I don't have an oven proof skillet, so I'm just going to put them in oven in a 9x13 baking glass dish." -- "I'm suppose to be making these indentantions for the eggs, but I'm not sure whether I'm going to be able fit 12 eggs." -- "I think I can only fit about 10, and they're definitely going to run together; no preventing that." -- "This is so weird, I've never done anything like this. Looks really good though." -- "OK, well, we can fit 9 eggs; we can't fit 12."
  - Oven-proof skillet should be noted in some listing of materials needed.

- Looking at step 5: "Finely grained parmesan. I can put as much parmesan in as I want. Mmmm."

- "This is REALLY good; could be served at a restaurant food.""

Q/A:

- Q: (prolonged silence) How is everything going? A: Good.

- Q: Was there any parallelizing you felt you could have done with this recipe that you were unable to? A: No, not with this recipe.
