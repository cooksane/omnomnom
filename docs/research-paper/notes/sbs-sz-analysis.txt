Analysis
	Comparing SBS to SZ
	    As # of steps increases, how does target acquisition time vary WRT Fitts' law + duration spent clicking to acquire target step?
	    * With overflow, # of visible targets k in target nav direction (relative to current target) decreases # of clicks by a factor of k.
	    * Consequently, want to show as many targets in direction more likely to navigate (the data suggests this!); * show more "next" targets than "previous" targets.
	    * Without overflow, this doesn't matter. However, finding (uniformly) *random* target with SZ interface is O(n) of number of targets. Current item position anchors search, and the structure of the task suggests targets local to the current item have higher probability of being selected. This can be shown by looking at distribution of target change relative to selected target: We have this data -> show a normal distribution for SZ. Show distribution for SBS as well (obviously normal, can be argued by deduction; no data needed). A greater standard deviation with respect to relative target selection distribution demonstrates usefulness of SZ over SBS (user needs more than just immediate local target acquisition). Measuring spikes in target switch deltas which are low (graph of # of items switched vs. time delta between items) can show user's need for more than just immediate local target acquisition (this is important to show for SBS). If we can show this for SBS, then this may be regarded as an increase in extraneous cognitive load, given the step-by-step detailed information the user must traverse over in order to acquire target.
	    * Also important to note that further analysis WRT to target acquisition may suggest that too many steps is bad (for target acquisition); but unclear whether this implies increase in cognitive load.
